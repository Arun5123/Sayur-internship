2. You are writing an essay. You don't want the any word to appear very frequently. Write a program that will take your essay as input (maybe from a file) and print the number of times each unique word appears in your essay.

Program:

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class  Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Provide the path to the file containing the essay
        String filePath = "essay.txt";

        // Initialize a HashMap to store word frequencies
        Map<String, Integer> wordFrequency = new HashMap<>();

        // Read the essay from file and count word frequencies
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] words = line.split("\\s+"); // Split by whitespace
                for (String word : words) {
                    // Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase (optional)
                    word = word.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "").toLowerCase();

                    // Count frequency of each word
                    if (!word.isEmpty()) {
                        wordFrequency.put(word, wordFrequency.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Print word frequencies
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordFrequency.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
